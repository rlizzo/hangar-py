Installation
============

For general usage it is recommended that you use a pre-built version of
Hangar, either from a Python Distribution, or a pre-built wheel from
PyPi.

Pre-Built Installation
----------------------

### Python Distributions

If you do not already use a Python Distribution, we recommend the
[Anaconda \<https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/\>]() (or [Miniconda
\<https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html\>]()) distribution,
which supports all major operating systems (Windows, MacOSX, & the
typical Linux variations). Detailed usage instructions are available [on
the anaconda website \<https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/\>]().

To install Hangar via the Anaconda Distribution (from the [conda-forge
conda channel \<https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/hangar\>]()):

    conda install -c conda-forge hangar

### Wheels (PyPi)

If you have an existing python installation on your computer, pre-built
Hangar Wheels can be installed via pip from the Python Package Index
(PyPi):

    pip install hangar

Source Installation
-------------------

To install Hangar from source, clone the repository from [Github
\<https://github.com/tensorwerk/hangar-py\>]():

    git clone https://github.com/tensorwerk/hangar-py.git
    cd hangar-py
    python setup.py install

Or use pip on the local package if you want to install all dependencies
automatically in a development environment:

    pip install -e .

### Source installation in Google colab

Google colab comes with an older version of `h5py` pre-installed which
is not compatible with hangar. If you need to install hangar from the
source in google colab, make sure to uninstall the existing `h5py` :

    !pip uninstall h5py

Then follow the Source Installation steps given above.
